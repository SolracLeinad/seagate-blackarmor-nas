# seagate-blackarmor-nas

## Preamble
Some years ago [I reverse engineered](archive/seagate-blackarmor-nas.txt) the Seagate Blackarmor NAS 220 and found a convenient way on [how to enable SSH on the device](archive/sg2000-2000.1337.sp42.img). Later, the same mechanism was used to install an [alternative Linux firmware (Debian 5 Lenny)](archive/custom-sg2000-2000.1337.sp99.img). Obviously, Debian 5 Lenny has reached end of life and should not be used in production anymore.

With the following instructions you'll manage to install a fully updateable Debian GNU/Linux system
to the NAS (kernel and initrd stored in NAND flash, updated via [flash-kernel package](https://packages.debian.org/stable/flash-kernel)).

## Hardware

All Blackarmor NAS devices are based on the Marvell 88F6000 SoC series with Sheeva CPU Technology,
which has been [released in 2008](https://www.marvell.com/company/newsroom/marvell-introduces-socs-to-boost-digital-home-gateway-and-pc-performance.html).

### NAS 110

Quick specs: 800 Mhz CPU (Marvell 88F6192), 128MB RAM, 1 USB port, 1 network interface, max 1 drive. Motherboard
codename '[Mono](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mono_Lake)'.

User [luctrev](https://github.com/luctrev) reports [a successful installation on his NAS 110](https://github.com/hn/seagate-blackarmor-nas/issues/6), so the hardware of the NAS 110 and 220 seems to be reasonable compatible.

### NAS 220

Quick specs: 800 Mhz CPU (Marvell 88F6192), 128MB RAM, 2 USB ports, 1 network interface, max 2 drives. Motherboard
codename '[Lassen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lassen_Peak)', based on Marvell DB-88F6192A-BP development board.

This script has been developed and tested on the Blackarmor NAS 220. There
haven't been any error reports for a long time, so I consider the system as
stable.

### NAS 400 / 420 / 440

Quick specs: 1.2 Ghz CPU (Marvell 88F6281), 256MB RAM, 4 USB ports, 2 network interfaces, max 4 drives. Motherboard
codename '[Shasta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Shasta)', based on Marvell DB-88F6281A-BP development board.

All the NAS 4XX series products have the same motherboard and 4-bay enclosure. The second digit in this number scheme refers to the
number of drives that ship with the device: no drives (NAS 400), 2 drives RAID 1 (NAS 420) and 4 drives RAID 5 (NAS 440).

:warning: Warning: Support for the NAS 4XX is currently experimental! Hard disk slots 1 and 2 do **not** work - 
[see details](#NAS-440-patch-details)). Do not install to your NAS if you plan to use more than two drives (slots 3 and 4).

## Install Debian GNU/Linux

### Warning

This completely removes the Seagate firmware and bootloader -- and there is no easy way of going back. There is a risk of bricking your device
([but there may be a way to revive it](#Revive-a-bricked-device)). You have been warned.

### Special note for NAS110 and NAS220

It is possible to install Debian 11 on a NAS110 or NAS220, but during the installation
process a `low memory` warning is displayed. It *seems* safe to ignore this warning.
During the installation process you have to manually load the installer
components `sata-modules-*-marvell-di`, `partman-ext3`, `partman-auto` and
`parted-udeb` into the installer via the menu item `Download installer components`.

When installing Debian 9 or 10 (default for NAS110 and NAS220), this warning does not occur.

### Prerequisites

Setup a serial terminal (`115200 baud 8N1` e.g. by using `sudo screen /dev/ttyUSB0 115200`) by connecting a 3.3V serial cable like this:

![Blackarmor NAS110 serial port](https://github.com/hn/seagate-blackarmor-nas/blob/master/blackarmor-nas110-debian-serialport.jpg "NAS 110 serial port")
![Blackarmor NAS220 serial port](https://github.com/hn/seagate-blackarmor-nas/blob/master/blackarmor-nas220-debian-serialport.jpg "NAS 220 serial port")
![Blackarmor NAS440 serial port](https://github.com/hn/seagate-blackarmor-nas/blob/master/blackarmor-nas440-debian-serialport.jpg "NAS 440 serial port")

### Preparing kernel and initrd images

This script generally supports installing Debian 9 (Stretch), Debian 10
(Buster, default for NAS110 and NAS220) and Debian 11 (Bullseye, default for NAS440).

Changing the default and installing Debian 11 (Bullseye) on the NAS110 and NAS220 is a bit more work
due to the limited RAM of only 128MB, check [this note](#Special-note-for-NAS110-and-NAS220) first.

Use your favourite Linux workstation to execute [`blackarmor-nas-debian-prep.sh`](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hn/seagate-blackarmor-nas/master/blackarmor-nas-debian-prep.sh) to download and prepare Das U-Boot bootloader and kernel image:

```
$ ./blackarmor-nas-debian-prep.sh

nand erase 0xA0000 0x10000
nand write 0x800000 0xA0000 0x10000
```

Copy the files `u-boot-nas220.kwb`, `u-boot-env.bin`, `uImage-dtb` and `uInitrd` from directory `blackarmor-nas220-debian` to a FAT formatted USB stick. Carefully examine the flash commands shown at the end of the script output.

### Flashing Das U-Boot bootloader

This step is only necessary for the very first installation. If you're updating or re-installing
Debian, directly skip to [Starting Debian installation](#Starting-Debian-installation).

Use the serial terminal to stop the Seagate boot process and to show the ethernet MAC address:

Write down the MAC adress, you'll need it later. Connect the USB stick to port 1 of the NAS and flash the new bootloader (enter `usb start ... nand write` commands exactly as shown during preparation phase):

```

Make sure to restart the NAS via `reset` command after flashing the bootloader!

If your nas just restarts with the error message `cpu reset` after the `fatload usb 0:1 0x800000 u-boot-nas220.kwb` command try to format the usb stick to `ext2` and use `ext2load ...` instead.

### Starting Debian installation

After resetting the NAS, connect a network cable to the NAS and execute `run bootcmd_usb` to start the Debian netboot installation:

```

Proceed with Debian installation as usual (configure RAID, select packages, ...). Ignore the `No installable kernel was found` and `No boot loader installed` warnings (`Continue without installing a kernel?`=`Yes` and `Continue`), but do not reboot yet!

### Finishing Debian installation

Before rebooting the installation system (the `Installation complete` screen appears) select the `Go Back` button. Select `Execute a shell` (second last option in main menu) and chroot to the target system:

```
# mount -o bind /proc /target/proc
# mount -o bind /sys /target/sys
# chroot /target
# cd /tmp
```

Download and execute [`blackarmor-nas-debian-postinstall.sh`](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hn/seagate-blackarmor-nas/master/blackarmor-nas-debian-postinstall.sh) like this:

```
# wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hn/seagate-blackarmor-nas/master/blackarmor-nas-debian-postinstall.sh

Set ethernet MAC address and enable autoboot (only needed after flashing Das U-Boot bootloader):

```
# fw_setenv ethaddr 00:10:75:42:42:42	# YOUR mac address as noted above
# fw_setenv eth1addr 00:10:75:42:ca:fe	# NAS440 only (dual NIC)
# fw_setenv bootdelay 3
# exit
# exit
```

Exit the shell, remove USB stick and reboot the system via the Debian installer main menu. Don't forget the `Finish installation` item last or you won't be able to login later!

### Additional tuning

- As Moritz [suggests](http://wiki.ccc-ffm.de/projekte:diverses:seagate_blackarmor_nas_220_debian#tuning) it is advisable to install the `lm-sensors` and `hdparm` packages.

- With [hwmon](https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/hwmon/sysfs-interface) you can adjust the fan
  speed automatically. This script installs a corresponding template file in `/etc/sysfs.d`.

## Revive a bricked device

The Marvell SoC waits in a very early boot phase on the serial port for a
special "magic" sequence, and when this is received, it accepts to transfer the boot loader via
[Xmodem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XMODEM). The `kwboot` tool can be used if your device
is bricked or if you want to test an U-Boot image before actually flashing to NAND. Simply
set up the serial port like this:

```
$ kwboot -b u-boot-nas440.kwb -p -t /dev/ttyS8
Sending boot message. Please reboot the target.../

To permanently flash the bootloader to NAND, follow the steps described
in [Flashing Das U-Boot bootloader](#Flashing-Das-U-Boot-bootloader).

## NAS 440 patch details

This [patch fully implements support for the NAS440 board and peripherals](u-boot-2022.04-nas440.diff)
within U-Boot. With the Linux kernel however there are problems, this is is work-in-progress:

- :construction_worker: Hard disk drives 1 and 2 are connected to a 88SE6121 SATA-II
  controller, which is connected via PCIe. The controller basically works, unfortunately
  the hard drives are _not_ beeing detected within the Linux kernel (`failed to IDENTIFY`).
  Update: Some 2.5" (5V) hard drives work, 3.5" (12V) hard drives do not work,
  [see this related bug report](https://forum.doozan.com/read.php?2,94079,95854#msg-95854).

- Hard disk drives 3 and 4 are connected to the 88F6281 SoC (on chip peripherals, OCP)
  and working. HDD power for drives 3 and 4 can be controlled via GPIO pin 28.

- The LCD has a HD44780 compatible controller communicating via 12 GPIO pins (8 bit data
  width). Support within U-Boot has been implemented (see `lcd_*` functions in `nas440.c`).

- The LEDs are connected via an 8-bit serial-in/parallel-out 74AHC164 shift register.
  Support within U-Boot has been implemented (see `led_*` functions in `nas440.c`).

- Various buttons (power, reset, LCD pageup/down) are connected via GPIO pins
  (see `GPIO_*` definitions in `nas440.h`).

## Credits

This project is based on the work of several dedicated people:

- Evgeni Dobrev created a [kernel patch to include hardware support for the Blackarmor 220 in the mainline linux
  kernel](https://lore.kernel.org/patchwork/patch/529020/).

- Moritz Rosenthal has released detailed docs on [how to update the NAS 220 with an up-to-date linux kernel and Debian
  distribution](http://wiki.ccc-ffm.de/projekte:diverses:seagate_blackarmor_nas_220_debian).

- [Andreas Fischer](https://github.com/bantu) did [groundbreaking work](https://gist.github.com/bantu/d456865b91be6c99320b)
  in providing an initial [U-Boot](https://github.com/bantu/u-boot/compare/master...sg-ba-440) and
  [kernel patch](https://github.com/bantu/linux/compare/master...kw-ba-400-dts) for the NAS 440.

- [Tony Dinh](https://mibodhi.blogspot.com/) has put enormous work into providing
  [U-Boot](https://forum.doozan.com/read.php?3,12381) and [Linux kernel and rootfs](https://forum.doozan.com/read.php?2,12096)
  binaries for other kirkwood-based devices.
